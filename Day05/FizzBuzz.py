# You are going to write a program that automatically prints the solution to the FizzBuzz game. These are the rules of the FizzBuzz game:

# Your program should print each number from 1 to 100 in turn and include number 100.

# When the number is divisible by 3 then instead of printing the number it should print "Fizz".

# When the number is divisible by 5, then instead of printing the number it should print "Buzz".`

# And if the number is divisible by both 3 and 5 e.g. 15 then instead of the number it should print "FizzBuzz
# Write your code here ðŸ‘‡

for number in range(1,101):
  if number % 3==0 and number % 5==0:
    print("FizzBuzz")
  elif number % 3==0:
    print("Fizz")
  elif number % 5==0:
   print("Buzz")
  else:
    print(number)

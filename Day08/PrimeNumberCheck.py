# You need to write a function that checks whether if the number passed into it is a prime number or not.

# e.g. 2 is a prime number because it's only divisible by 1 and 2.

# But 4 is not a prime number because you can divide it by 1, 2 or 4

# Write your code below this line 👇
def prime_checker(number):
  is_prime=True
  for i in range (2,number):
    if number%i==0:
      is_prime=False
  if is_prime:
    print("It's a prime number.")
  else:
    print("It's not a prime number.")
  




# Write your code above this line 👆
    
#Do NOT change any of the code below👇
n = int(input()) # Check this number
prime_checker(number=n)

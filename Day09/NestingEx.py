# Instructions
# You are going to write a program that adds to a travel_log. You can see a travel_log which is a List that contains 2 Dictionaries. Your job is to create a function that can add new countries to this list.

# Write a function that will work with the following line of code on line 21 to add the entry for Brazil to the travel_log.

# add_new_country("Brazil", 5, ["Sao Paulo", "Rio de Janeiro"])
# DO NOT modify the travel_log directly. The goal is to create a function that modifies it.

# Example Input
# Brazil
# 5
# ["Sao Paulo", "Rio de Janeiro"]
# Example Output
# I've been to Brazil 5 times.
# My favourite city was Sao Paulo.

country = input() # Add country name
visits = int(input()) # Number of visits
list_of_cities = eval(input()) # create list from formatted string

travel_log = [
  {
    "country": "France",
    "visits": 12,
    "cities": ["Paris", "Lille", "Dijon"]
  },
  {
    "country": "Germany",
    "visits": 5,
    "cities": ["Berlin", "Hamburg", "Stuttgart"]
  },
]
# Do NOT change the code above ðŸ‘†

# TODO: Write the function that will allow new countries
# to be added to the travel_log. 
def add_new_country(country,visits,list_of_cities):
  travel_log.append({"country":country,
                "visits":visits,
                "cities":list_of_cities
               })
  

# Do not change the code below ðŸ‘‡
add_new_country(country, visits, list_of_cities)
print(f"I've been to {travel_log[2]['country']} {travel_log[2]['visits']} times.")
print(f"My favourite city was {travel_log[2]['cities'][0]}.")

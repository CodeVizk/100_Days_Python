# Import can be of three types

# 1- importing the module and then using its Function, good for few items/variable
# import turtle
# jim = turtle.Turtle()

# # 2-Importing specify thing, makes it easier to write
# from turtle import Turtle
# kim = Turtle()
# tim = Turtle()

# # 3- imports everything from the module not recommended by professional, good coders
# from turtle import *
# shape("circle")


# Modules can be imported with alias.
import turtle as t
jimmy = t.Turtle()


# Modules can be installed for specific projects only in a virtual environment

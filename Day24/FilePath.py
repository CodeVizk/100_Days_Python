# There are two file paths - Absolute path and relative path

# Absolute path is relative to root path i.e local disk c or any user specified directory
# Relative path is the directory in which the user is currently working on like here 100_Days_Python/Day24/...

# to use relative path use ./ to specify current directory or ../ to access the upper directory of hierarchy

# Instructions
# You are going to use Dictionary Comprehension to create a dictionary called result that takes each word in the given sentence and calculates the number of letters in each word.
#
# Try Googling to find out how to convert a sentence into a list of words.
#
# Do NOT Create a dictionary directly. Try to use Dictionary Comprehension instead of a Loop.
#

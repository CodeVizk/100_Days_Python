# Instructions
# You are going to write a List Comprehension to create a new list called squared_numbers.
# This new list should contain every number in the list numbers but each number should be squared.
#
# e.g. 4 * 4 = 16
# 4 squared equals 16.
# DO NOT modify the List numbers directly. Try to use List Comprehension instead of a Loop.
#
# Target Output
# [1, 1, 4, 9, 25, 64, 169, 441, 1156, 3025]
# Hint
# Use the keyword method for starting the List comprehension and fill in the relevant parts.
#
# Make sure the squared_numbers is printed into the console for the code checking to work.

numbers = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55]
# ğŸš¨ Do Not Change the code above ğŸ‘†

# Write your 1 line code ğŸ‘‡ below:
squared_numbers = [i*i for i in numbers]
# Write your code ğŸ‘† above:


print(squared_numbers)

# Instructions
# You have access to a database of student_scores in the format of a dictionary. The keys in student_scores are the names of the students and the values are their exam scores.

# Write a program that converts their scores to grades. By the end of your program, you should have a new dictionary called student_grades that should contain student names for keys and their grades for values.

# The final version of the student_grades dictionary will be checked.

# DO NOT modify lines 1-7 to change the existing student_scores dictionary.

# DO NOT write any print statements.

# This is the scoring criteria:

# Scores 91 - 100: Grade = "Outstanding"

# Scores 81 - 90: Grade = "Exceeds Expectations"

# Scores 71 - 80: Grade = "Acceptable"

# Scores 70 or lower: Grade = "Fail"


student_scores = {
  "Harry": 81,
  "Ron": 78,
  "Hermione": 99, 
  "Draco": 74,
  "Neville": 62,
